@inproceedings{Ayatollahi2013,
abstract = {A robotized manufacturing cell is a distributed system composed of elements such as robots, machine tools and peripheral devices whose actions must be coordinated by a cell controller. Robotized manufacturing cells usually are preconfigured, often available commercially off-the-shelf for a specific type of processing, and may not be reconfigured outside of the pre-defined level of automation due to poor communication capabilities. This lack of reconfigurability often implies low usage of equipment. This fully applies to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) due to rather small and often varying lot sizes. This fact presents a technological and economical barrier to the automation of many manufacturing processes in SMEs. OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a promising standard specification for interconnectivity in state-of-the-art industrial automation technology, enabling rich information modelling capabilities. In this paper we present the design of a prototype OPC UA server for numerically controlled machine tools (such as milling and turning machines) providing a semantic communication interface for the cell controller and neighbouring automation components. The OPC UA server exposes all relevant objects of the machine tool such as automation equipment, tools and NC-programs with the respective variables, methods, and properties. Methods represent functions of the machine tool that can be called by an OPC UA client (e.g. open work area door, close fixture), allowing easy orchestration of all operations necessary for automated job execution. The OPC UA Server has been implemented and tested in an existing manufacturing cell composed of an EMCO Concept Turn 55 machine tool, an ABB IRB 120 industrial robot and a cell controller. Communication between OPC UA server and numerical control of the machine tool is based on a proprietary DNC protocol. Introduction In a robotized manufacturing cell material flow and NC program selection and start may be managed by the numerical control or the robot control. Delegating these tasks to a dedicated cell controller that orchestrates activities of the cell devices allows more flexibility and operating comfort. But the implementation of a cell controller is a complex task due to different communication protocols and machines supplied from different vendors. During the 1970ies the first flexible manufacturing systems came into existence and vendor specific communication protocols for file related operations, data collection and remote control of NC machine tools evolved. In the beginning these protocols were based on the LSV2-or DK3964R procedures for serial point-to-point communication [1, 2]. Later on communication based on Ethernet and TCP/IP came into use, such as MCIS RPC Sinumerik Computer Link developed by Siemens [3]. In the 1990ies an attempt was made to standardize the communication in flexible manufacturing cells and systems by introducing the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS). Leit{\~{a}}o et al. [4] presented an integration solution for two CNC machines and an anthropomorphic robot, where all system components were equipped with MAP (Manufacturing Automation Protocol) / MMS interface boards. But only a small subset of the MMS services defined in ISO 9506 was implemented by the MMS communication modules due to the limitations on the objects and services implemented by server applications. The high expectations concerning MMS could not be fulfilled. For simple cell configurations the use of digital inputs and outputs for signal exchange is still widely accepted. In 2011 the German Engineering Foundation (VDMA) released a specification of signals for the organization of the machine tending process (VDMA 34180). This specification is aimed at reducing the expense for integrating robots and machine tools [5]. The German initiative known as " Industry 4.0. " is about connecting machines with goods via the internet, for example in a production facility. This means that products and machines will be able to communicate with each other in a common language. Reality looks somewhat different. The suppliers of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) software provide a huge number of communication drivers for different automation and information systems, and system integrators struggle with a whole lot of different communication protocols and message frames. OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), a communications and data modelling standard for the exchange of information over TCP/IP networks, could solve this problem as it provides data and semantics of data at the same time. At the Institute for Production Engineering and Laser Technology (IFT), Vienna University of Technology, the use of OPC UA is being evaluated for remote control of machine tools in robotized manufacturing cells. Although Classic OPC DA is already an established standard for machine data and process data collection, the recent OPC UA is still not common in this field. Especially with the introduction of methods, OPC UA seems to be very promising for use in the field of production automation. The clear semantics of the address space not only allows sophisticated M2M communication, it can also empower manufacturing cell operators to comprehensively browse and easily control the automation components with any OPC UA client available. This article presents a prototype OPC UA server for a machine tool control enabling communication in a robotized manufacturing cell. The cell controller may collect data from the machine tool and is able to remotely control the machine tool. The prototype has been tested in a robotized manufacturing cell composed of an EMCO Concept Turn 55 (a turning lathe designed for educational purposes) and an ABB IRB 120 industrial robot (see Fig. 1). Development of the prototype application is based on the " C++ UA Server SDK " and " .NET UA Client SDK " provided by Unified Automation.},

In these architectures intelligence is put respectively at the product and through the network of workstation computers. The cost of embedded specialized hardware required for the first option is still very high. The second option needs the utilization of Automatic Identification and Data Capture technology close to the product to permit its identification and tracking by the computer system. These technologies enable the automated identification of objects, the collection of data about them, and the storage of that data directly into computer systems. Through this network, the computer system can access or update information in databases about the products and connect with software agents that represent production orders and resources and take in common decisions through negotiation and contract-based rules. The theory of the proposed solutions is based on the holonic manufacturing and product-driven automation concepts. The implementation methodology along with experimental results is presented, emphasizing the advantages of each solution.},

@article{Downey2016,
abstract = {For many years there has been considerable research from both an academic and industrial perspective into the monitoring and control of CNC machining processes, and progress has been well documented. It is widely acknowledged within the CIRP community that collection of information into the performance of material cutting processes is a worthwhile research topic, and this is mirrored in the work of the Scientific Technical Committee-Cutting (STC-C) and other Scientific Technical Committees. This work has been continued by the consortium engaged in the REALISM project, an EU-FP7 funded project which is investigating the use of sensor fusion in a real time production environment, to monitor CNC tool wear through the use of three sensor technologies- Force, Acoustic Emission and Vibration. However, the real work of the project consortium will be in the analysis and interpretation of the data from the collated fusion of the deployed sensors- and the intelligent interrogation of this sensor information. The sensor deployment strategy of this project was outlined in a presentation, poster and paper presented at the 2014 CIRP ICME conference and this current paper provides an update on the ongoing work. An overview is provided in this paper of the challenges that have been overcome as part of the REALISM project, and a brief overview of the initial verification trials that were undertaken on the deployment of the sensors. Further results will also be presented that show promising initial sensor data, which shows conditions leading to Catastrophic Tool Failure (CTF).},

abstract = {Rapidly changing customer demands lead to a paradigm shift from mass production to mass customization within the manufacturing industry. However, todays production systems are of a very static nature. Changing the manufacturing process requires a high amount of expensive human resources and is quite error prone. Hence, reconfigurability will become a key factor in the manufacturing industry and industrial automation systems must provide suitable solutions to support this new paradigm. Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) are a potential technology which can provide the requested capability of automatic reconfiguration. Originating from the IT world, the adaptation of SOAs to industrial automation systems has to face several difficulties - especially real-time requirements must be met. This paper proposes an innovative solution approach for the integration of a SOA into real-time systems for industrial automation.},

abstract = {The pressure of global competition has led the urge of highly individualizes products to sustain in the market. This entailed a rise of information technologies in area of discrete manufacturing, which has led to Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) and later to Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS). Both paradigms struggle with stiff hierarchical control architectures, and a lack of flexibility. To overcome those limitations, the aim is to integrate the concepts of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) into the factory automation domain. By elaborating a way to induct the paradigm of SOA in Manufacturing Execution System (MES), a supporting framework will be established. This will enable an autonomous model for multi agent based control architecture of a demonstration cell. This proposal aims to work out those synergies and to give a short envision of the state of the art, in order to expound the authors previous approach and an outlook. The previous approach was built around a demonstrator manufacturing cell, where an OPC UA server has been developed for the machine control. Through the capability of evolving method into the information model, the opportunity of sequencing rudimentary services to higher services processes occurred. The outlook will show how we plan to merge those higher services to a service oriented Manufacturing Execution System, by taking the guideline VDI 5600 into consideration.},

abstract = {Manufacturing has faced significant changes during the last years, namely the move from a local economy towards a global and competitive economy, with markets demanding for highly customized products of high quality at lower costs, and with short life cycles. In this environment, manufacturing enterprises, to remain competitive, must respond closely to customer demands by improving their flexibility and agility, while maintaining their productivity and quality. Dynamic response to emergence is becoming a key issue in manufacturing field because traditional manufacturing control systems are built upon rigid control architectures, which cannot respond efficiently and effectively to dynamic change. In these circumstances, the current challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems that exhibit intelligence, robustness and adaptation to the environment changes and disturbances. The introduction of multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems paradigms addresses these requirements, bringing the advantages of modularity, decentralization, autonomy, scalability and re-usability. This paper surveys the literature in manufacturing control systems using distributed artificial intelligence techniques, namely multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems principles. The paper also discusses the reasons for the weak adoption of these approaches by industry and points out the challenges and research opportunities for the future.},

abstract = {Research in automating the process level of machining operations has been conducted, in both academia and industry, over the past few decades. This work is motivated by a strong belief that research in this area will provide increased productivity, improved part quality, reduced costs, and relaxed machine design constraints. The basis for this belief is two-fold. First, machining process automation can be applied to both large batch production environments and small batch jobs. Second, process automation can autonomously tune machine parameters (feed, speed, depth of cut, etc.) on-line and off-line to substantially increase the machine tool's performance in terms of part tolerances and surface finish, operation cycle time, etc. Process automation holds the promise of bridging the gap between product design and process planning, while reaching beyond the capability of a human operator. The success of manufacturing process automation hinges primarily on the effectiveness of the process monitoring and control systems. This paper discusses the evolution of machining process monitoring and control technologies and conducts an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art of these technologies over the past decade. The research in each area is highlighted with experimental and simulation examples. Open architecture software platforms that provide the means to implement process monitoring and control systems are also reviewed. The impact, industrial realization, and future trends of machining process monitoring and control technologies are also discussed.},

It has been possible to compensate somewhat for this pressure in recent years by relocating production to low-cost countries. However, in the medium term, the demands of workers in countries that are now still low cost will increase, and production costs will rise as a result, so the need for action will arise. Tools will be needed to increase efficiency in existing production processes. It also must be considered that production in high-cost countries definitely has its advantages, so these countries are becoming more and more feasible as production locations and will remain so in the long term. The degree of automation is already extremely high in these countries, so modifying production processes will not increase efficiency significantly.},

The new technologies met well the requirements in all domains of manufacturing where problems of uncertainty and temporal dynamics, information sharing and distributed operation, or coordination and cooperation of autonomous entities had to be tackled. In the paper software agents and multi-agent systems are introduced and through a comprehensive survey, their potential manufacturing applications are outlined. Special emphasis is laid on methodological issues and deployed industrial systems. After discussing open issues and strategic research directions, we conclude that the evolution of agent technologies and manufacturing will probably proceed hand in hand. The former can receive real challenges from the latter, which, in turn, will have more and more benefits in applying agent technologies, presumably together with well-established or emerging approaches of other disciplines.},

An example is a smart factory that can adapt to new product variants or production systems, as a result of which, it guarantees a minimum energy consumption in any production scenario. At the heart of this is the capability to generate the automation software based on new requirements, i.e. based on the product description. Currently, two main solution philosophies exist to implement such an automatic software synthesis:1.Compositional approaches generate the software by sticking predefined software components together.2.Synthesis approaches generate the software from scratch based on models of the product and the production resources. We will outline and compare both solutions in-detail. Furthermore, the necessary models are described in this paper. Using examples from the field of manufacturing systems and from industrial automation, we will argue that only the second approach is suited to fulfil the promises of cyber-physical production systems.},

One of the challenges for future research and development is to simplify the connectivity between automation equipment (e.g. robot and machine tool). Still automation equipment is connected via digital inputs and outputs or fieldbus systems and configuration can only be done at considerable expense. To meet the requirements for higher flexibility in robotized manufacturing cells an information and communication architecture, in which new components (e.g. NC controls) can easily be integrated, is required. In this paper we present a cell cache based on blackboard communication architecture that allows adding or removing hard and software-components without reinventing the information architecture. For implementation of the developed approach a robotized manufacturing cell consisting of two machine tools and a robot was assembled.

abstract = {Current control systems are limited from a technical viewpoint in areas such as scalability, start-up and reconfiguration time and computational complexity for algorithms. These limitations call for a new concept for control systems to address current and future requirements. It has been suggested that the physical location of the control system be moved from that of the machine to a cloud, i.e. control system as a service (CSaaS). In this way, the control system becomes scalable and can handle highly complex computational tasks while keeping the process know-hows. Utilizing capabilities of modern Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN) the control system can be connected with the rest of the machine, e.g. drives, sensors, devices and HMI. This approach, however, presents new challenges, i.e. the requirement for integration of network, cloud computing and control system expertize.

abstract = {STEP-NC (formalized as ISO 14649 and ISO 10303 AP238) is a new interface (or language) standard for the CAD–CAM–CNC chain, currently under establishment by ISO TC184 SC1 and SC4. Upon completion, it will replace ISO 6983, so called M {\&} G codes used for CNC since 1950s. As the new language is being established, a new CNC controller called STEP-CNC (STEP-compliant CNC), capable of carrying out various intelligent tasks using the new language as an input, receives worldwide attention. Shop-floor programming (SFP) system is a computer-assisted part programming system interfaced with STEP-CNC. Its primary function is to generate part program in ISO 14649 (or STEP AP238) to machine the part geometry given by STEP AP203 or AP224 file. In this paper, we first present an architecture for the SFP system, followed by implementation technology including: (1) STEP physical file interpretation, (2) feature recognition, (3) process planning, (4) part program generation, and (5) verification. The developed methodology was implemented in a prototype called PosSFP, and tested with Korea STEP-NC system.},

abstract = {Today's machining shop floors, characterized by large variety of products in small batch sizes, require dynamic control and real-time monitoring capabilities that are responsive and adaptive to the rapid changes of production capability and functionality. It is especially true when the shop floors are combined with the e-manufacturing concept. However, a highly efficient infrastructure that can integrate the pieces of automated equipment together and link them to the e-manufacturing is still missing. The objective of this research is to develop an appropriate methodology with open architecture for real-time monitoring and remote control of networked CNC machines. A framework named Wise-ShopFloor (Web-based-integrated sensor-driven e-ShopFloor) is designed for this purpose. Within the context, this paper presents a new enabling technology to bring traditional CNC machine tools on-line with combined monitoring and control capability. Issues such as architecture design, methodology development, and prototype implementation are addressed through a milling machine case study. It is expected that the developed technology can be readily applied to real shop floor environments with increased productivity, flexibility, and responsiveness.},

The aim of this research is to showcase the advantages of, and evaluate, STEP-NC—a new NC data model—by implementing it in a legacy CNC system. The work consists of two parts: retrofitting an existing CNC machine and the development of a STEP-compliant NC Converter called STEPcNC. The CompuCam's motion control system is used for retrofitting the machine, which is programmable using its own motion control language—6K Motion Control language and capable of interfacing with other CAPP/CAM programs through languages such as Visual Basic, Visual C++ and Delphi. STEPcNC can understand and process STEP-NC codes, and interface with the CNC controller through a Human Machine Interface. It makes use of STEP-NC information such as “Workplan”, “Workingstep”, machining strategy, machining features and cutting tools that is present in a STEP-NC file. Hence, the system is truly feature-based. The Application Interpreted Model of STEP-NC has been used.},

On the contrary additive manufacturing (rapid prototyping) has total automation but compromises quality. A hybrid layered manufacturing process presented in this study combines the best features of both these approaches. It uses arc weld deposition for building near-net shapes, which are subsequently finish machined. Time and cost savings of this process can be attributed to reduction in NC programming effort and elimination of rough machining. It is envisioned as a low cost retrofitment to any existing CNC machine for making metallic objects without disturbing its original functionalities. Near-net shape building and finish machining happening at the same station is the unique feature of this process. A customized software generates the NC program for near-net shape building. The intricate details of integrating arc welding unit with a CNC milling machine are presented in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},
