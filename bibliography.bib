abstract = {The pressure of global competition has led the urge of highly individualizes products to sustain in the market. This entailed a rise of information technologies in area of discrete manufacturing, which has led to Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) and later to Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS). Both paradigms struggle with stiff hierarchical control architectures, and a lack of flexibility. To overcome those limitations, the aim is to integrate the concepts of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) into the factory automation domain. By elaborating a way to induct the paradigm of SOA in Manufacturing Execution System (MES), a supporting framework will be established. This will enable an autonomous model for multi agent based control architecture of a demonstration cell. This proposal aims to work out those synergies and to give a short envision of the state of the art, in order to expound the authors previous approach and an outlook. The previous approach was built around a demonstrator manufacturing cell, where an OPC UA server has been developed for the machine control. Through the capability of evolving method into the information model, the opportunity of sequencing rudimentary services to higher services processes occurred. The outlook will show how we plan to merge those higher services to a service oriented Manufacturing Execution System, by taking the guideline VDI 5600 into consideration.},

abstract = {A robotized manufacturing cell is a distributed system composed of elements such as robots, machine tools and peripheral devices whose actions must be coordinated by a cell controller. Robotized manufacturing cells usually are preconfigured, often available commercially off-the-shelf for a specific type of processing, and may not be reconfigured outside of the pre-defined level of automation due to poor communication capabilities. This lack of reconfigurability often implies low usage of equipment. This fully applies to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) due to rather small and often varying lot sizes. This fact presents a technological and economical barrier to the automation of many manufacturing processes in SMEs. OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a promising standard specification for interconnectivity in state-of-the-art industrial automation technology, enabling rich information modelling capabilities. In this paper we present the design of a prototype OPC UA server for numerically controlled machine tools (such as milling and turning machines) providing a semantic communication interface for the cell controller and neighbouring automation components. The OPC UA server exposes all relevant objects of the machine tool such as automation equipment, tools and NC-programs with the respective variables, methods, and properties. Methods represent functions of the machine tool that can be called by an OPC UA client (e.g. open work area door, close fixture), allowing easy orchestration of all operations necessary for automated job execution. The OPC UA Server has been implemented and tested in an existing manufacturing cell composed of an EMCO Concept Turn 55 machine tool, an ABB IRB 120 industrial robot and a cell controller. Communication between OPC UA server and numerical control of the machine tool is based on a proprietary DNC protocol. Introduction In a robotized manufacturing cell material flow and NC program selection and start may be managed by the numerical control or the robot control. Delegating these tasks to a dedicated cell controller that orchestrates activities of the cell devices allows more flexibility and operating comfort. But the implementation of a cell controller is a complex task due to different communication protocols and machines supplied from different vendors. During the 1970ies the first flexible manufacturing systems came into existence and vendor specific communication protocols for file related operations, data collection and remote control of NC machine tools evolved. In the beginning these protocols were based on the LSV2-or DK3964R procedures for serial point-to-point communication [1, 2]. Later on communication based on Ethernet and TCP/IP came into use, such as MCIS RPC Sinumerik Computer Link developed by Siemens [3]. In the 1990ies an attempt was made to standardize the communication in flexible manufacturing cells and systems by introducing the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS). Leit{\~{a}}o et al. [4] presented an integration solution for two CNC machines and an anthropomorphic robot, where all system components were equipped with MAP (Manufacturing Automation Protocol) / MMS interface boards. But only a small subset of the MMS services defined in ISO 9506 was implemented by the MMS communication modules due to the limitations on the objects and services implemented by server applications. The high expectations concerning MMS could not be fulfilled. For simple cell configurations the use of digital inputs and outputs for signal exchange is still widely accepted. In 2011 the German Engineering Foundation (VDMA) released a specification of signals for the organization of the machine tending process (VDMA 34180). This specification is aimed at reducing the expense for integrating robots and machine tools [5]. The German initiative known as " Industry 4.0. " is about connecting machines with goods via the internet, for example in a production facility. This means that products and machines will be able to communicate with each other in a common language. Reality looks somewhat different. The suppliers of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) software provide a huge number of communication drivers for different automation and information systems, and system integrators struggle with a whole lot of different communication protocols and message frames. OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), a communications and data modelling standard for the exchange of information over TCP/IP networks, could solve this problem as it provides data and semantics of data at the same time. At the Institute for Production Engineering and Laser Technology (IFT), Vienna University of Technology, the use of OPC UA is being evaluated for remote control of machine tools in robotized manufacturing cells. Although Classic OPC DA is already an established standard for machine data and process data collection, the recent OPC UA is still not common in this field. Especially with the introduction of methods, OPC UA seems to be very promising for use in the field of production automation. The clear semantics of the address space not only allows sophisticated M2M communication, it can also empower manufacturing cell operators to comprehensively browse and easily control the automation components with any OPC UA client available. This article presents a prototype OPC UA server for a machine tool control enabling communication in a robotized manufacturing cell. The cell controller may collect data from the machine tool and is able to remotely control the machine tool. The prototype has been tested in a robotized manufacturing cell composed of an EMCO Concept Turn 55 (a turning lathe designed for educational purposes) and an ABB IRB 120 industrial robot (see Fig. 1). Development of the prototype application is based on the " C++ UA Server SDK " and " .NET UA Client SDK " provided by Unified Automation.},

abstract = {Research in automating the process level of machining operations has been conducted, in both academia and industry, over the past few decades. This work is motivated by a strong belief that research in this area will provide increased productivity, improved part quality, reduced costs, and relaxed machine design constraints. The basis for this belief is two-fold. First, machining process automation can be applied to both large batch production environments and small batch jobs. Second, process automation can autonomously tune machine parameters (feed, speed, depth of cut, etc.) on-line and off-line to substantially increase the machine tool's performance in terms of part tolerances and surface finish, operation cycle time, etc. Process automation holds the promise of bridging the gap between product design and process planning, while reaching beyond the capability of a human operator. The success of manufacturing process automation hinges primarily on the effectiveness of the process monitoring and control systems. This paper discusses the evolution of machining process monitoring and control technologies and conducts an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art of these technologies over the past decade. The research in each area is highlighted with experimental and simulation examples. Open architecture software platforms that provide the means to implement process monitoring and control systems are also reviewed. The impact, industrial realization, and future trends of machining process monitoring and control technologies are also discussed.},

abstract = {Manufacturing has faced significant changes during the last years, namely the move from a local economy towards a global and competitive economy, with markets demanding for highly customized products of high quality at lower costs, and with short life cycles. In this environment, manufacturing enterprises, to remain competitive, must respond closely to customer demands by improving their flexibility and agility, while maintaining their productivity and quality. Dynamic response to emergence is becoming a key issue in manufacturing field because traditional manufacturing control systems are built upon rigid control architectures, which cannot respond efficiently and effectively to dynamic change. In these circumstances, the current challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems that exhibit intelligence, robustness and adaptation to the environment changes and disturbances. The introduction of multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems paradigms addresses these requirements, bringing the advantages of modularity, decentralization, autonomy, scalability and re-usability. This paper surveys the literature in manufacturing control systems using distributed artificial intelligence techniques, namely multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems principles. The paper also discusses the reasons for the weak adoption of these approaches by industry and points out the challenges and research opportunities for the future.},

Bei einer in letzter Zeit stark zunehmenden Anzahl von Realzeitanwendungen k{\"{o}}nnen ohne die Ber{\"{u}}cksichtigung solcher Forderungen keine praktisch brauchbaren L{\"{o}}sungen erwartet werden. Einige Anwendungsfelder werden angesprochen. Im Einzelnen werden dann f{\"{u}}r Elektroautos, die mit erneuerbaren Energien betrieben werden sollen, einerseits die Management-, verteilte Verhandlungs- und Verteilungsprobleme der ben{\"{o}}tigten Energie in einem bottom-up Ansatz gel{\"{o}}st. Andererseits wird als Teil unserer Projektarbeit die Bereitstellung von Reserveenergie f{\"{u}}r den allgemeinen Bedarf durch Autobatterien vorgestellt. Es zeigt sich, dass dies effizienter und wesentlich kurzfristiger in unserem verteilten Vorgehen geschehen kann als in traditionellen Verfahren.},

@article{Piechnick2012,
abstract = {Due to the wide acceptance and distribution of mobile devices, it has become increasingly important that an application is able to adapt to a changing environment. This implies the necessity to integrate varying functionality at runtime being activated depending on the current context. A common approach is to foresee and model all possible influencing factors and to integrate the required software building blocks in advance. But, due to the constant change of the environment, as described by Lehman's laws, it is impossible to anticipate all future situations. Hence, modeling the entire adaptation process at design time prohibits the adaptation to unanticipated scenarios and, thus, is likely to lead to the malfunctioning of the adaptive application in the future. In this paper we focus on unanticipated, dynamic self-variation of applications (i.e., without a central coordinator) and propose a role-based composition system that enables the adjustment of the structure and functionality of software-objects in a fine-grained manner. Systems following our proposed approach form a Smart Application Grid (SMAG). The SMAGs-Approach is putting emphasis on dynamic collaborations between components within an application and between several different software systems. Therefore, role-modeling is used to model and perform dynamic variation of applications at runtime, whereby roles are stored in central repositories. This allows the integration of previously unknown software-building-blocks and the dynamic adaptation to situations that were not foreseen.},

@article{Meyer2010,
abstract = {The globalization of the economy and the associated factors of increasing effectiveness in production, shortening innovation cycles, safeguarding high quality, etc. are continually augmenting the pressure on the production business. It has been possible to compensate somewhat for this pressure in recent years by relocating production to low-cost countries. However, in the medium term, the demands of workers in countries that are now still low cost will increase, and production costs will rise as a result, so the need for action will arise. Tools will be needed to increase efficiency in existing production processes. It also must be considered that production in high-cost countries definitely has its advantages, so these countries are becoming more and more feasible as production locations and will remain so in the long term. The degree of automation is already extremely high in these countries, so modifying production processes will not increase efficiency significantly.},

@article{Riehle1998,
abstract = {Today, any large object-oriented software system is built using frameworks. Yet, designing frameworks and defining their interaction with clients remains a difficult task. A primary reason is that today's dominant modeling concept, the class, is not well suited to describe the complexity of object collaborations as it emerges in framework design and integration. We use role modeling to overcome the problems and limitations of class-based modeling. Using role models, the design of a framework and its use by clients can be described succinctly and with much better separation of concerns than with classes. Using role objects, frameworks can be integrated into use-contexts that have not been foreseen by their original designers.},
