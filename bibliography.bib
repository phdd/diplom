abstract = {The globalization of the economy and the associated factors of increasing effectiveness in production, shortening innovation cycles, safeguarding high quality, etc. are continually augmenting the pressure on the production business. It has been possible to compensate somewhat for this pressure in recent years by relocating production to low-cost countries. However, in the medium term, the demands of workers in countries that are now still low cost will increase, and production costs will rise as a result, so the need for action will arise. Tools will be needed to increase efficiency in existing production processes. It also must be considered that production in high-cost countries definitely has its advantages, so these countries are becoming more and more feasible as production locations and will remain so in the long term. The degree of automation is already extremely high in these countries, so modifying production processes will not increase efficiency significantly.},

abstract = {Today's machining shop floors, characterized by large variety of products in small batch sizes, require dynamic control and real-time monitoring capabilities that are responsive and adaptive to the rapid changes of production capability and functionality. It is especially true when the shop floors are combined with the e-manufacturing concept. However, a highly efficient infrastructure that can integrate the pieces of automated equipment together and link them to the e-manufacturing is still missing. The objective of this research is to develop an appropriate methodology with open architecture for real-time monitoring and remote control of networked CNC machines. A framework named Wise-ShopFloor (Web-based-integrated sensor-driven e-ShopFloor) is designed for this purpose. Within the context, this paper presents a new enabling technology to bring traditional CNC machine tools on-line with combined monitoring and control capability. Issues such as architecture design, methodology development, and prototype implementation are addressed through a milling machine case study. It is expected that the developed technology can be readily applied to real shop floor environments with increased productivity, flexibility, and responsiveness.},

It integrates information and decisions in data flow (of machine/process level), information level (of factory and supply system level), and cash flow (of business system level). This transition is dependent upon the advancement of next-generation manufacturing practices on “e-factory and e-automation ” which is focused on the use of information to make things happen collaboratively on a global basis.},

However, service providers, not having the autonomy to decide who they collaborate with, might be reluctant to participate in such open systems, the client being the sole responsible of the selection of ser-vices for the composition. Multiagent systems research offer some solutions in term of trust and reputation mechanisms as well as in coalition forma-tion theory. This paper presents a multiagent based negotiation model to enable provider autonomy in composite web services. QoS-based reputa-tion is built from both feedbacks retrieved from execution and from subjec-tive feedbacks given by the client. This model is illustrated by an example based on the Language Grid Project, an service infrastructure for language resources.},

abstract = {Research in automating the process level of machining operations has been conducted, in both academia and industry, over the past few decades. This work is motivated by a strong belief that research in this area will provide increased productivity, improved part quality, reduced costs, and relaxed machine design constraints. The basis for this belief is two-fold. First, machining process automation can be applied to both large batch production environments and small batch jobs. Second, process automation can autonomously tune machine parameters (feed, speed, depth of cut, etc.) on-line and off-line to substantially increase the machine tool's performance in terms of part tolerances and surface finish, operation cycle time, etc. Process automation holds the promise of bridging the gap between product design and process planning, while reaching beyond the capability of a human operator. The success of manufacturing process automation hinges primarily on the effectiveness of the process monitoring and control systems. This paper discusses the evolution of machining process monitoring and control technologies and conducts an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art of these technologies over the past decade. The research in each area is highlighted with experimental and simulation examples. Open architecture software platforms that provide the means to implement process monitoring and control systems are also reviewed. The impact, industrial realization, and future trends of machining process monitoring and control technologies are also discussed.},

abstract = {This editorial introduces the special issue of the Elsevier journal, Engineering Application of Artificial Intelligence, on Distributed control of production systems. The current technology in communication and embedded systems allows products and production resources to play a more active role in the production process. This new active capacity will generate major changes in organizations and information systems (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)). New approaches are now required for modelling, testing and assessing the features made possible by the decisional and informational capabilities of these new active entities. One among the many possibilities is to use agents and holons, since agent and holon-based approaches assume interaction between intelligent entities to facilitate the emergence of a global behavior. This special issue thus focuses on the possible applications of distributed approaches for the design, evaluation and implementation of new control architectures for production systems. Both fundamental and applied research papers are presented.},

abstract = {Manufacturing has faced significant changes during the last years, namely the move from a local economy towards a global and competitive economy, with markets demanding for highly customized products of high quality at lower costs, and with short life cycles. In this environment, manufacturing enterprises, to remain competitive, must respond closely to customer demands by improving their flexibility and agility, while maintaining their productivity and quality. Dynamic response to emergence is becoming a key issue in manufacturing field because traditional manufacturing control systems are built upon rigid control architectures, which cannot respond efficiently and effectively to dynamic change. In these circumstances, the current challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems that exhibit intelligence, robustness and adaptation to the environment changes and disturbances. The introduction of multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems paradigms addresses these requirements, bringing the advantages of modularity, decentralization, autonomy, scalability and re-usability. This paper surveys the literature in manufacturing control systems using distributed artificial intelligence techniques, namely multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems principles. The paper also discusses the reasons for the weak adoption of these approaches by industry and points out the challenges and research opportunities for the future.},

abstract = {The duality of objects and relationships is so deeply embedded in our thinking that almost all modelling languages include it as a fundamental distinction. Yet there is evidence that the two are naturally complemented by a third, equally fundamental notion: that of roles. Although de{\textregistered}nitions of the role concept abound in the literature, we maintain that only few are truly original, and that even fewer acknowledge the intrinsic role of roles as intermediaries between relationships and the objects that engage in them. After discussing the major families of role conceptualiza-tions, we present our own basic de{\textregistered}nition and demonstrate how it naturally accounts for many modelling issues, in-cluding multiple and dynamic classi{\textregistered}cation, object collaboration, polymorphism, and substitutability. {\'{O}}},

Over the years, G-codes (ISO 6983) have been extensively used by the CNC machine tools for part programming and are now considered as a bottleneck for developing next generation of CNC machines. A new standard known as STEP-NC is being developed as the data model for a new breed of CNC machine tools. The data model represents a common standard specifically aimed at the intelligent CNC manufacturing workstation, making the goal of a standardised CNC controller and NC code generation facility a reality. It is believed that CNC machines implementing STEP-NC will be the basis for a more open and adaptable architecture.

The new technologies met well the requirements in all domains of manufacturing where problems of uncertainty and temporal dynamics, information sharing and distributed operation, or coordination and cooperation of autonomous entities had to be tackled. In the paper software agents and multi-agent systems are introduced and through a comprehensive survey, their potential manufacturing applications are outlined. Special emphasis is laid on methodological issues and deployed industrial systems. After discussing open issues and strategic research directions, we conclude that the evolution of agent technologies and manufacturing will probably proceed hand in hand. The former can receive real challenges from the latter, which, in turn, will have more and more benefits in applying agent technologies, presumably together with well-established or emerging approaches of other disciplines.},

abstract = {Due to their autonomy and social behaviour, agents will play important roles in emerging enterprises; they will fill key positions and provide essential capabilities. This paper describes role modelling as a software engineering technique for specifying, analysing, and designing systems on the basis of the roles that the agents will play. This paper builds on our earlier research in patterns of agent systems. A pattern is a useful solution to a reoccurring problem in a particular context; patterns can be used to solve software engineering problems in analysis, design, and implementation. This paper explains how object-oriented role models can be extended to represent patterns of agent interaction that can then be employed to engineer agent systems. Role theory deals with collaboration and co-ordination. Roles have also been applied to distributed systems management, and to agent and robot systems. However, there has to date not been a methodology for realising these representations in an automated or semi-automated system, due to the lack of adequate formalism and corresponding abstractions in software. Role models rectify this situation for software analysis, design, and implementation.},

abstract = {The establishment of mobile devices had a high impact on the use and development of software systems. It is expected that the ability to automatically adapt to changing environments will be a crucial property for future apps running on mobile devices. The problem with current approaches for self-adaptive systems is that developers must define the adaptive behaviour at design-time. In many cases, however, the developer cannot predict all situations at design-time, which should trigger adaptation at runtime. Furthermore, applications for mobile devices are usually optimized for a small set of use cases and have a narrow, well-defined scope. In order to support more complex tasks, the functionality of several apps has to be composed dynamically. Another problem arises from the ever increasing number of available applications. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a novel infrastructure for self-adaptive systems in smart environments, namely ContextPoint. Our goal is to describe an architecture which supports unanticipated adaptation for single systems, as well as the automatic integration of actuators and sensors, situated in the environment, with services and data from both, mobile devices and the cloud. Therefore, a distributed adaptation technique is proposed, where adaptation logic and rules are provided by the environment itself. This decentralization simplifies the development of self-adaptive systems with dynamic adaptive adaptation processes (meta-adaptation) and, thus, the design and operation of systems with unanticipated adaptation. Furthermore, our approach provides means for describing context-dependent collaboration between varying systems enabling the design of ad-hoc system-of-systems.},

@article{Piechnick2012,
abstract = {Due to the wide acceptance and distribution of mobile devices, it has become increasingly important that an application is able to adapt to a changing environment. This implies the necessity to integrate varying functionality at runtime being activated depending on the current context. A common approach is to foresee and model all possible influencing factors and to integrate the required software building blocks in advance. But, due to the constant change of the environment, as described by Lehman's laws, it is impossible to anticipate all future situations. Hence, modeling the entire adaptation process at design time prohibits the adaptation to unanticipated scenarios and, thus, is likely to lead to the malfunctioning of the adaptive application in the future. In this paper we focus on unanticipated, dynamic self-variation of applications (i.e., without a central coordinator) and propose a role-based composition system that enables the adjustment of the structure and functionality of software-objects in a fine-grained manner. Systems following our proposed approach form a Smart Application Grid (SMAG). The SMAGs-Approach is putting emphasis on dynamic collaborations between components within an application and between several different software systems. Therefore, role-modeling is used to model and perform dynamic variation of applications at runtime, whereby roles are stored in central repositories. This allows the integration of previously unknown software-building-blocks and the dynamic adaptation to situations that were not foreseen.},

A primary reason is that today's dominant modeling concept, the class, is not well suited to describe the complexity of object collaborations as it emerges in framework design and integration. We use role modeling to overcome the problems and limitations of class-based modeling. Using role models, the design of a framework and its use by clients can be described succinctly and with much better separation of concerns than with classes. Using role objects, frameworks can be integrated into use-contexts that have not been foreseen by their original designers.},
