abstract = {Recent advances in manufacturing industry has paved way for a systematical deployment of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), within which information from all related perspectives is closely monitored and synchronized between the physical factory floor and the cyber computational space. Moreover, by utilizing advanced information analytics, networked machines will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently. Such trend is transforming manufacturing industry to the next generation, namely Industry 4.0. At this early development phase, there is an urgent need for a clear definition of CPS. In this paper, a unified 5-level architecture is proposed as a guideline for implementation of CPS.},

abstract = {Rapidly changing customer demands lead to a paradigm shift from mass production to mass customization within the manufacturing industry. However, todays production systems are of a very static nature. Changing the manufacturing process requires a high amount of expensive human resources and is quite error prone. Hence, reconfigurability will become a key factor in the manufacturing industry and industrial automation systems must provide suitable solutions to support this new paradigm. Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) are a potential technology which can provide the requested capability of automatic reconfiguration. Originating from the IT world, the adaptation of SOAs to industrial automation systems has to face several difficulties - especially real-time requirements must be met. This paper proposes an innovative solution approach for the integration of a SOA into real-time systems for industrial automation.},

abstract = {Autonomic Computing is a concept that brings together many fields of computing with the purpose of creating computing systems that self-manage. In its early days it was criticised as being a “hype topic” or a rebadging of some Multi Agent Systems work. In this survey, we hope to show that this was not indeed ‘hype' and that, though it draws on much work already carried out by the Computer Science and Control communities, its innovation is strong and lies in its robust application to the specific self-management of computing systems. To this end, we first provide an introduction to the motivation and concepts of autonomic computing and describe some research that has been seen as seminal in influencing a large proportion of early work. Taking the components of an established reference model in turn, we discuss the works that have provided significant contributions to that area.We then look at larger scaled systems that compose autonomic systems illustrating the hierarchical nature of their architectures. Autonomicity is not a well defined subject and as such different systems adhere to different degrees of Autonomicity, therefore we cross-slice the body of work in terms of these degrees. From this we list the key applications of autonomic computing and discuss the research work that is missing and what we believe the community should be considering},

abstract = {Programming Internet of Things (IoT) applications is challenging because developers have to be knowledgeable in various technical domains, from low-power networking, over embedded operating systems, to distributed algorithms. Hence, it will be challenging to find enough experts to provide software for the vast number of expected devices, which must also be scalable and particularly safe due to the connection to the physical world. To remedy this situation, we propose an architecture that provides Web-like scripting for low-end devices through Cloud-based application servers and a consistent, RESTful programming model. Our novel runtime container Actinium (Ac) exposes scripts, their configuration, and their lifecycle management through a fully RESTful programming interface using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). We endow the JavaScript language with an API for direct interaction with mote-class IoT devices, the CoapRequest object, and means to export script data as Web resources. With Actinium, applications can be created by simply mashing up resources provided by CoAP servers on devices, other scripts, and classic Web services. We also discuss security considerations and show the suitability of this architecture in terms of performance with our publicly available implementation.},

abstract = {Manufacturing has faced significant changes during the last years, namely the move from a local economy towards a global and competitive economy, with markets demanding for highly customized products of high quality at lower costs, and with short life cycles. In this environment, manufacturing enterprises, to remain competitive, must respond closely to customer demands by improving their flexibility and agility, while maintaining their productivity and quality. Dynamic response to emergence is becoming a key issue in manufacturing field because traditional manufacturing control systems are built upon rigid control architectures, which cannot respond efficiently and effectively to dynamic change. In these circumstances, the current challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems that exhibit intelligence, robustness and adaptation to the environment changes and disturbances. The introduction of multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems paradigms addresses these requirements, bringing the advantages of modularity, decentralization, autonomy, scalability and re-usability. This paper surveys the literature in manufacturing control systems using distributed artificial intelligence techniques, namely multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems principles. The paper also discusses the reasons for the weak adoption of these approaches by industry and points out the challenges and research opportunities for the future.},

However, today there are no clear technical criteria how to classify distributed self-∗ systems within the resulting design spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a classification by looking on runtime models and their coupling. As runtime models capture the shared knowledge employed by feedback loops, at first, we provide an improved runtime model categorization. With such a basis, we subsequently derive impact relations describing the coupling of runtime models. Finally, we show that the existence of complex impact relations can be employed to describe the spectrum of self-∗ systems.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are controlled complex technical systems. On one hand they do exist and behave in the physical world with their dedicated physical and technical rules. On the other hand they are controlled according to certain policies – frequently by a “tandem” of control systems and human operators. Modern cars, aircrafts, power grids, production lines etc. are typical cyber-physical systems. The unprecedented technology development has enabled these systems to play an increasingly central role in modern societies. However, to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of CPS operations is always a challenging task since they are often heterogeneous, large-scale and very complex for conventional software systems. In this paper we propose a novel rule-based approach combining deductive and reactive rules to specify and describe CPS. Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Event-Condition- Action (ECA) rules are used to detect situations of interest in CPS and issuing (complex) control actions, respectively. This allows us to focus on the “what” of CPS control (situation detection, reaction specification) and leaves the “how” to a well defined event and action engine. Whereas events are treated in CPS much the same as in other fields actions are quite different because they happen in the real world. We describe an approach to CPS actions which takes these important particularities into account. Another important issue is the integration of physical models into event and action processing. Temporal aspects play a central role here. Our approach enables us to control CPSs under both normal and exceptional conditions in a flexible and efficient way. In order to illustrate the basic features and expressivities of the proposed approach we consider realistic industrial situations.},

abstract = {Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is more popular than ever in a lot of different application domains. Initially used only at the enterprise level this approach is now spreading to the other layers down to the device level. In this context, the interoperability between the systems and the devices communicating across all domains and layers has to be particularly well defined. This interoperability addresses not only the communication protocols but also the semantic of the exchanged data. In the first part, this document focuses on the exchanged data, explaining the basics of some data modeling standards, illustrating the data modeling from the point of view of specific domains and showing how a common cross-domain data model can be achieved. The second part addresses more the communication part, explaining how the exchange of data could be enhanced by the convergence of OPC UA and DPWS. Previous studies already showed that a convergence between DPWS and OPC UA was feasible and interesting. This document demonstrates some additional benefits and presents a real implementation of such a convergence on an embedded device.},

abstract = {This paper describes two heterarchical architectures which use distributed intelligence for the control (operation scheduling, resource allocation and product routing) of a manufacturing cell. In these architectures intelligence is put respectively at the product and through the network of workstation computers. The cost of embedded specialized hardware required for the first option is still very high. The second option needs the utilization of Automatic Identification and Data Capture technology close to the product to permit its identification and tracking by the computer system. These technologies enable the automated identification of objects, the collection of data about them, and the storage of that data directly into computer systems. Through this network, the computer system can access or update information in databases about the products and connect with software agents that represent production orders and resources and take in common decisions through negotiation and contract-based rules. The theory of the proposed solutions is based on the holonic manufacturing and product-driven automation concepts. The implementation methodology along with experimental results is presented, emphasizing the advantages of each solution.},

abstract = {Providing high-quality software in the face of uncertainties, such as dealing with new user needs, changing availability of resources, and faults that are difficult to predict, raises fundamental challenges to software engineers. These challenges have motivated the need for self-adaptive systems. One of the primary claimed benefits of self-adaptation is that a design with external feedback loops provide a more effective engineering solution for self-adaptation compared to a design with internal mechanisms. While many efforts indicate the validity of this claim, to the best of our knowledge, no controlled experiments have been performed that provide scientifically founded evidence for it. Such experiments are crucial for researchers and engineers to underpin their claims and improve research. In this paper, we report the results of a controlled experiment performed with 24 final-year students of a Master in Software Engineering program in which designs based on external feedback loops are compared with designs based on internal mechanisms. The results show that applying external feedback loops can reduce control flow complexity and fault density, and improve productivity. We found no evidence for a reduction of activity complexity.},

These limitations call for a new concept for control systems to address current and future requirements. It has been suggested that the physical location of the control system be moved from that of the machine to a cloud, i.e. control system as a service (CSaaS). In this way, the control system becomes scalable and can handle highly complex computational tasks while keeping the process know-hows. Utilizing capabilities of modern Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN) the control system can be connected with the rest of the machine, e.g. drives, sensors, devices and HMI. This approach, however, presents new challenges, i.e. the requirement for integration of network, cloud computing and control system expertize. This paper will focus on the requirements of the communication for a cloud based control system.},

One of the challenges for future research and development is to simplify the connectivity between automation equipment (e.g. robot and machine tool). Still automation equipment is connected via digital inputs and outputs or fieldbus systems and configuration can only be done at considerable expense. To meet the requirements for higher flexibility in robotized manufacturing cells an information and communication architecture, in which new components (e.g. NC controls) can easily be integrated, is required. In this paper we present a cell cache based on blackboard communication architecture that allows adding or removing hard and software-components without reinventing the information architecture. For implementation of the developed approach a robotized manufacturing cell consisting of two machine tools and a robot was assembled.

abstract = {Research in automating the process level of machining operations has been conducted, in both academia and industry, over the past few decades. This work is motivated by a strong belief that research in this area will provide increased productivity, improved part quality, reduced costs, and relaxed machine design constraints. The basis for this belief is two-fold. First, machining process automation can be applied to both large batch production environments and small batch jobs. Second, process automation can autonomously tune machine parameters (feed, speed, depth of cut, etc.) on-line and off-line to substantially increase the machine tool's performance in terms of part tolerances and surface finish, operation cycle time, etc. Process automation holds the promise of bridging the gap between product design and process planning, while reaching beyond the capability of a human operator. The success of manufacturing process automation hinges primarily on the effectiveness of the process monitoring and control systems. This paper discusses the evolution of machining process monitoring and control technologies and conducts an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art of these technologies over the past decade. The research in each area is highlighted with experimental and simulation examples. Open architecture software platforms that provide the means to implement process monitoring and control systems are also reviewed. The impact, industrial realization, and future trends of machining process monitoring and control technologies are also discussed.},

abstract = {The pressure of global competition has led the urge of highly individualizes products to sustain in the market. This entailed a rise of information technologies in area of discrete manufacturing, which has led to Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) and later to Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS). Both paradigms struggle with stiff hierarchical control architectures, and a lack of flexibility. To overcome those limitations, the aim is to integrate the concepts of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) into the factory automation domain. By elaborating a way to induct the paradigm of SOA in Manufacturing Execution System (MES), a supporting framework will be established. This will enable an autonomous model for multi agent based control architecture of a demonstration cell. This proposal aims to work out those synergies and to give a short envision of the state of the art, in order to expound the authors previous approach and an outlook. The previous approach was built around a demonstrator manufacturing cell, where an OPC UA server has been developed for the machine control. Through the capability of evolving method into the information model, the opportunity of sequencing rudimentary services to higher services processes occurred. The outlook will show how we plan to merge those higher services to a service oriented Manufacturing Execution System, by taking the guideline VDI 5600 into consideration.},

abstract = {Future manufacturing systems will require to process large amounts of complex data due to a rising demand on visibility and vertical integration of factory floor devices with higher level systems. Systems contained in higher layers of the business model are rapidly moving towards a Service Oriented Architecture, inducing a tendency to push Web Technologies down to the factory floor level. Evidence of this trend is the addition of Web Services at the device level with Device Profile for Web Services and the transition of OPC based on COM/DCOM communication to OPC-UA based on Web Services. DPWS and OPC-UA are becoming nowadays the preferred options to provide on a device level, service-oriented solutions capable to extended with an Event Driven Architecture into manufacturing systems. Furthermore, it has been shown that interoperability between these two can enhance the implementation of a Service Oriented Architecture for industrial purposes. This paper proposes an implementation solution for supervision and monitoring of manufacturing systems on the factory floor level. The proposal involves management of heterogeneous events incoming from OPC-UA and DPWS using a complex event processor. The approach presented is applicable in distributed systems that may require an advance interpretation of data incoming from these two communication protocols.},

@inproceedings{Ayatollahi2013,
abstract = {A robotized manufacturing cell is a distributed system composed of elements such as robots, machine tools and peripheral devices whose actions must be coordinated by a cell controller. Robotized manufacturing cells usually are preconfigured, often available commercially off-the-shelf for a specific type of processing, and may not be reconfigured outside of the pre-defined level of automation due to poor communication capabilities. This lack of reconfigurability often implies low usage of equipment. This fully applies to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) due to rather small and often varying lot sizes. This fact presents a technological and economical barrier to the automation of many manufacturing processes in SMEs. OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a promising standard specification for interconnectivity in state-of-the-art industrial automation technology, enabling rich information modelling capabilities. In this paper we present the design of a prototype OPC UA server for numerically controlled machine tools (such as milling and turning machines) providing a semantic communication interface for the cell controller and neighbouring automation components. The OPC UA server exposes all relevant objects of the machine tool such as automation equipment, tools and NC-programs with the respective variables, methods, and properties. Methods represent functions of the machine tool that can be called by an OPC UA client (e.g. open work area door, close fixture), allowing easy orchestration of all operations necessary for automated job execution. The OPC UA Server has been implemented and tested in an existing manufacturing cell composed of an EMCO Concept Turn 55 machine tool, an ABB IRB 120 industrial robot and a cell controller. Communication between OPC UA server and numerical control of the machine tool is based on a proprietary DNC protocol. Introduction In a robotized manufacturing cell material flow and NC program selection and start may be managed by the numerical control or the robot control. Delegating these tasks to a dedicated cell controller that orchestrates activities of the cell devices allows more flexibility and operating comfort. But the implementation of a cell controller is a complex task due to different communication protocols and machines supplied from different vendors. During the 1970ies the first flexible manufacturing systems came into existence and vendor specific communication protocols for file related operations, data collection and remote control of NC machine tools evolved. In the beginning these protocols were based on the LSV2-or DK3964R procedures for serial point-to-point communication [1, 2]. Later on communication based on Ethernet and TCP/IP came into use, such as MCIS RPC Sinumerik Computer Link developed by Siemens [3]. In the 1990ies an attempt was made to standardize the communication in flexible manufacturing cells and systems by introducing the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS). Leit{\~{a}}o et al. [4] presented an integration solution for two CNC machines and an anthropomorphic robot, where all system components were equipped with MAP (Manufacturing Automation Protocol) / MMS interface boards. But only a small subset of the MMS services defined in ISO 9506 was implemented by the MMS communication modules due to the limitations on the objects and services implemented by server applications. The high expectations concerning MMS could not be fulfilled. For simple cell configurations the use of digital inputs and outputs for signal exchange is still widely accepted. In 2011 the German Engineering Foundation (VDMA) released a specification of signals for the organization of the machine tending process (VDMA 34180). This specification is aimed at reducing the expense for integrating robots and machine tools [5]. The German initiative known as " Industry 4.0. " is about connecting machines with goods via the internet, for example in a production facility. This means that products and machines will be able to communicate with each other in a common language. Reality looks somewhat different. The suppliers of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) software provide a huge number of communication drivers for different automation and information systems, and system integrators struggle with a whole lot of different communication protocols and message frames. OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), a communications and data modelling standard for the exchange of information over TCP/IP networks, could solve this problem as it provides data and semantics of data at the same time. At the Institute for Production Engineering and Laser Technology (IFT), Vienna University of Technology, the use of OPC UA is being evaluated for remote control of machine tools in robotized manufacturing cells. Although Classic OPC DA is already an established standard for machine data and process data collection, the recent OPC UA is still not common in this field. Especially with the introduction of methods, OPC UA seems to be very promising for use in the field of production automation. The clear semantics of the address space not only allows sophisticated M2M communication, it can also empower manufacturing cell operators to comprehensively browse and easily control the automation components with any OPC UA client available. This article presents a prototype OPC UA server for a machine tool control enabling communication in a robotized manufacturing cell. The cell controller may collect data from the machine tool and is able to remotely control the machine tool. The prototype has been tested in a robotized manufacturing cell composed of an EMCO Concept Turn 55 (a turning lathe designed for educational purposes) and an ABB IRB 120 industrial robot (see Fig. 1). Development of the prototype application is based on the " C++ UA Server SDK " and " .NET UA Client SDK " provided by Unified Automation.},

It is widely acknowledged within the CIRP community that collection of information into the performance of material cutting processes is a worthwhile research topic, and this is mirrored in the work of the Scientific Technical Committee-Cutting (STC-C) and other Scientific Technical Committees. This work has been continued by the consortium engaged in the REALISM project, an EU-FP7 funded project which is investigating the use of sensor fusion in a real time production environment, to monitor CNC tool wear through the use of three sensor technologies- Force, Acoustic Emission and Vibration. However, the real work of the project consortium will be in the analysis and interpretation of the data from the collated fusion of the deployed sensors- and the intelligent interrogation of this sensor information. The sensor deployment strategy of this project was outlined in a presentation, poster and paper presented at the 2014 CIRP ICME conference and this current paper provides an update on the ongoing work. An overview is provided in this paper of the challenges that have been overcome as part of the REALISM project, and a brief overview of the initial verification trials that were undertaken on the deployment of the sensors. Further results will also be presented that show promising initial sensor data, which shows conditions leading to Catastrophic Tool Failure (CTF).},

It is especially true when the shop floors are combined with the e-manufacturing concept. However, a highly efficient infrastructure that can integrate the pieces of automated equipment together and link them to the e-manufacturing is still missing. The objective of this research is to develop an appropriate methodology with open architecture for real-time monitoring and remote control of networked CNC machines. A framework named Wise-ShopFloor (Web-based-integrated sensor-driven e-ShopFloor) is designed for this purpose. Within the context, this paper presents a new enabling technology to bring traditional CNC machine tools on-line with combined monitoring and control capability. Issues such as architecture design, methodology development, and prototype implementation are addressed through a milling machine case study. It is expected that the developed technology can be readily applied to real shop floor environments with increased productivity, flexibility, and responsiveness.},

Most changes made can be replicated on similar discrete manufacturing settings, as the leveraging technology is Web Services deploying Service Oriented Architecture. The newly introduced technologies and devices can greatly help to address both needs imposed by the market (e.g. fast product customization) and by the society (e.g. the energy savings desired in the manufacturing domain by 2020).},

abstract = {Der Trend zu Hochautomatisierung im Hochlohnland Deutschland schien lange ungebrochen. Es zeigt sich jedoch, dass in der Praxis bei mehr als einem Drittel der Betriebe mit automatisierten L{\"{o}}sungen die damit verbundenen Erwartungen nicht erf{\"{u}}llt werden konnten. Viele dieser Betriebe haben bereits einen Reduzierung des Automatisierungsniveaus bei bestimmten Teilsystemen durchgef{\"{u}}hrt. Der wichtigste Grund f{\"{u}}r die Unzufriedenheit ist die Inflexibilit{\"{a}}t dieser Anlagen. Die Flexibilit{\"{a}}tsanforderungen, die sich durch Umsatzschwankungen aber auch Produktionsumstellungen auf neue Produkte ergeben, k{\"{o}}nnen nur mit erheblichem Aufwand bei hochautomatisierten bei hochautomatisierten Anlagen umgesetzt werden. Dies trifft in besonderem Umfang auf den Bereich der Montage zu. Fast 50 Prozent der Betriebe mit einem starken Umsatzwachstum haben ihr Automatisierungsniveau beim Materialfluss in der Montage bereits reduziert oder planen dies. Diese Ergebnisse sind unabh{\"{a}}ngig von der Betriebsgr{\"{o}}{\ss}e. Betriebe, die bereits Overengineering in der Produktion abgebaut haben, kehren jedoch nicht einfach zu den Produktionskonzepten vor der Automatisierung zur{\"{u}}ck. Vielen Betrieben gelingt es, die Erfahrung sinnvoll umzusetzen und bei einem reduzierten und angepassten Automatisierungsniveau ein verbessertes Niveau bei Ausschussquoten und bei der Termintreue zu erreichen.},

@article{Candido2010,
abstract = {Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) is increasingly relevant across several domains of application by promising systems openness and unification over a common design and communication paradigm. At device level, the application of SOA is carried, on one hand, by Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) and complementary web-based specifications oriented towards resource management, and, on the other hand, by OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) framework. These are currently the major candidates to be deployed at device level in a service-oriented industrial scenario. This document offers an overlook over both approaches, along with some complementary WS-* specifications through an extensive technical assessment. Also, it illustrates that neither one of these specifications can alone entirely cope with the requirements of service-oriented industrial domain device level and that a combined approach promises to deliver an important contribution. Synergies between the two sets of specifications for a more conformant solution are identified, and a convergence approach is enunciated in an era where it is imperative to avoid unnecessary layers of integration across enterprise infrastructure to ensure a more agile, lean and sustainable development.},

abstract = {The globalization of the economy and the associated factors of increasing effectiveness in production, shortening innovation cycles, safeguarding high quality, etc. are continually augmenting the pressure on the production business. It has been possible to compensate somewhat for this pressure in recent years by relocating production to low-cost countries. However, in the medium term, the demands of workers in countries that are now still low cost will increase, and production costs will rise as a result, so the need for action will arise. Tools will be needed to increase efficiency in existing production processes. It also must be considered that production in high-cost countries definitely has its advantages, so these countries are becoming more and more feasible as production locations and will remain so in the long term. The degree of automation is already extremely high in these countries, so modifying production processes will not increase efficiency significantly.},

The aim is to increase the changeability of these systems through intelligent and self-configuring devices. Prerequisite is an appropriate communication capability down to the lowest sensor level, which is, however, difficult to achieve in current industrial environments. This article describes the origin of this complexity and the requirements future factories will have to meet. Based on the analysis of current industrial environments, a system architecture is developed, allowing the automatic integration of field devices from heterogeneous communication networks. The concept is compatible with existing devices and presents a unified information model for the standardized data exchange with other information systems.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical production systems' main feature is adaptability, i.e. they adapt automatically to new situations without impairing the system's goals. An example is a smart factory that can adapt to new product variants or production systems, as a result of which, it guarantees a minimum energy consumption in any production scenario. At the heart of this is the capability to generate the automation software based on new requirements, i.e. based on the product description. Currently, two main solution philosophies exist to implement such an automatic software synthesis:1.Compositional approaches generate the software by sticking predefined software components together.2.Synthesis approaches generate the software from scratch based on models of the product and the production resources. We will outline and compare both solutions in-detail. Furthermore, the necessary models are described in this paper. Using examples from the field of manufacturing systems and from industrial automation, we will argue that only the second approach is suited to fulfil the promises of cyber-physical production systems.},
