abstract = {Today's machining shop floors, characterized by large variety of products in small batch sizes, require dynamic control and real-time monitoring capabilities that are responsive and adaptive to the rapid changes of production capability and functionality. It is especially true when the shop floors are combined with the e-manufacturing concept. However, a highly efficient infrastructure that can integrate the pieces of automated equipment together and link them to the e-manufacturing is still missing. The objective of this research is to develop an appropriate methodology with open architecture for real-time monitoring and remote control of networked CNC machines. A framework named Wise-ShopFloor (Web-based-integrated sensor-driven e-ShopFloor) is designed for this purpose. Within the context, this paper presents a new enabling technology to bring traditional CNC machine tools on-line with combined monitoring and control capability. Issues such as architecture design, methodology development, and prototype implementation are addressed through a milling machine case study. It is expected that the developed technology can be readily applied to real shop floor environments with increased productivity, flexibility, and responsiveness.},

Over the years, G-codes (ISO 6983) have been extensively used by the CNC machine tools for part programming and are now considered as a bottleneck for developing next generation of CNC machines. A new standard known as STEP-NC is being developed as the data model for a new breed of CNC machine tools. The data model represents a common standard specifically aimed at the intelligent CNC manufacturing workstation, making the goal of a standardised CNC controller and NC code generation facility a reality. It is believed that CNC machines implementing STEP-NC will be the basis for a more open and adaptable architecture.

In the paper software agents and multi-agent systems are introduced and through a comprehensive survey, their potential manufacturing applications are outlined. Special emphasis is laid on methodological issues and deployed industrial systems. After discussing open issues and strategic research directions, we conclude that the evolution of agent technologies and manufacturing will probably proceed hand in hand. The former can receive real challenges from the latter, which, in turn, will have more and more benefits in applying agent technologies, presumably together with well-established or emerging approaches of other disciplines.},

abstract = {The establishment of mobile devices had a high impact on the use and development of software systems. It is expected that the ability to automatically adapt to changing environments will be a crucial property for future apps running on mobile devices. The problem with current approaches for self-adaptive systems is that developers must define the adaptive behaviour at design-time. In many cases, however, the developer cannot predict all situations at design-time, which should trigger adaptation at runtime. Furthermore, applications for mobile devices are usually optimized for a small set of use cases and have a narrow, well-defined scope. In order to support more complex tasks, the functionality of several apps has to be composed dynamically. Another problem arises from the ever increasing number of available applications. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a novel infrastructure for self-adaptive systems in smart environments, namely ContextPoint. Our goal is to describe an architecture which supports unanticipated adaptation for single systems, as well as the automatic integration of actuators and sensors, situated in the environment, with services and data from both, mobile devices and the cloud. Therefore, a distributed adaptation technique is proposed, where adaptation logic and rules are provided by the environment itself. This decentralization simplifies the development of self-adaptive systems with dynamic adaptive adaptation processes (meta-adaptation) and, thus, the design and operation of systems with unanticipated adaptation. Furthermore, our approach provides means for describing context-dependent collaboration between varying systems enabling the design of ad-hoc system-of-systems.},

abstract = {Due to the wide acceptance and distribution of mobile devices, it has become increasingly important that an application is able to adapt to a changing environment. This implies the necessity to integrate varying functionality at runtime being activated depending on the current context. A common approach is to foresee and model all possible influencing factors and to integrate the required software building blocks in advance. But, due to the constant change of the environment, as described by Lehman's laws, it is impossible to anticipate all future situations. Hence, modeling the entire adaptation process at design time prohibits the adaptation to unanticipated scenarios and, thus, is likely to lead to the malfunctioning of the adaptive application in the future. In this paper we focus on unanticipated, dynamic self-variation of applications (i.e., without a central coordinator) and propose a role-based composition system that enables the adjustment of the structure and functionality of software-objects in a fine-grained manner. Systems following our proposed approach form a Smart Application Grid (SMAG). The SMAGs-Approach is putting emphasis on dynamic collaborations between components within an application and between several different software systems. Therefore, role-modeling is used to model and perform dynamic variation of applications at runtime, whereby roles are stored in central repositories. This allows the integration of previously unknown software-building-blocks and the dynamic adaptation to situations that were not foreseen.},

It has been possible to compensate somewhat for this pressure in recent years by relocating production to low-cost countries. However, in the medium term, the demands of workers in countries that are now still low cost will increase, and production costs will rise as a result, so the need for action will arise. Tools will be needed to increase efficiency in existing production processes. It also must be considered that production in high-cost countries definitely has its advantages, so these countries are becoming more and more feasible as production locations and will remain so in the long term. The degree of automation is already extremely high in these countries, so modifying production processes will not increase efficiency significantly.},

We use role modeling to overcome the problems and limitations of class-based modeling. Using role models, the design of a framework and its use by clients can be described succinctly and with much better separation of concerns than with classes. Using role objects, frameworks can be integrated into use-contexts that have not been foreseen by their original designers.},

abstract = {This paper is an analysis patterns paper, hence I'm looking at the alternatives from a conceptual point of view, rather than an implementation point of view. I'm asking how we represent our view of the world in our software, and I'm not looking at important implemenation issues such as performance, distribution, concurrency etc. I've provided some code samples, but they are there to illustrate the conceptual ideas rather than as statements of what the implementation should look like.},

@article{Kendall1999,
abstract = {Due to their autonomy and social behaviour, agents will play important roles in emerging enterprises; they will fill key positions and provide essential capabilities. This paper describes role modelling as a software engineering technique for specifying, analysing, and designing systems on the basis of the roles that the agents will play. This paper builds on our earlier research in patterns of agent systems. A pattern is a useful solution to a reoccurring problem in a particular context; patterns can be used to solve software engineering problems in analysis, design, and implementation. This paper explains how object-oriented role models can be extended to represent patterns of agent interaction that can then be employed to engineer agent systems. Role theory deals with collaboration and co-ordination. Roles have also been applied to distributed systems management, and to agent and robot systems. However, there has to date not been a methodology for realising these representations in an automated or semi-automated system, due to the lack of adequate formalism and corresponding abstractions in software. Role models rectify this situation for software analysis, design, and implementation.},
